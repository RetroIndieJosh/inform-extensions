# Joshua McLean Extensions - Install Instructions

**Linux**: If your inform directory is `~/Inform` (the default) you can use the
included `linux-install.sh` to install or update all extensions.

(forthcoming) ~~**Windows**: If your inform directory is `%UserProfile%/My Documents/Inform` 
(the default) you can use the included `windows-install.bat` to install or
update all extensions.~~

**Manual/Custom Installation**: Copy the extension's directory from `Extensions`
to your `{inform-directory}/Extensions` directory.

**Verify**: Check the Inform 7 "Extensions" tab for a listing of the installed
extensions under `Joshua McLean`. You may need to restart Inform 7 to see them
added.

**Test**: Open and run the relevant project from the `Tests` directory. In the
`Story` tab, use the command `test me`.

**Use**: Add an extension to your project with the line:
    `Include {extension-name} by Joshua McLean.`
    
**Help**: Each project includes documentation accessible through the Inform 7
interface. (TODO: more detailed instructions).
