"Keypad"

Include Keypad by Joshua McLean.

The Exterior is a room.

A locked closed door called the security door is north of the exterior.

A scenery keypad called the security keypad is in the exterior. Understand "key pad" as the security keypad. The code is "1928". The locked target is the security door.

To get the code right for the security keypad:
	now the security door is unlocked;
	continue the action.

The Interior is north of the security door.

Test me with "push 10 / push -2 / push 5 / push 3 / push 2 / push 9 / push 1 / push 9 / push 2 / push 8 / push 5 / open door / north".
