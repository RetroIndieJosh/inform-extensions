The check for missing descriptions when play begins rule is not listed in any rulebook.

The player carries the bathroom key.

The Bedroom is a room. "Nothing but a bed and an exit south." A scenery bed called the small bed is here. A pillow, a sheet, and a book are on it. Yourself is seated. Yourself is on the small bed.

The Hall is south of the bedroom. "Nothing interesting here - just leads to the bathroom west and the bedroom north."

A closed locked door called the bathroom door is west of the hall. The bathroom key unlocks it.

A room called the Bathroom is west of the bathroom door. "The countertop here is super clean. East lies the hallway."
A scenery supporter called the countertop is here. Understand "counter top" and "counter" as the countertop. On the countertop are a toothbrush and a comb. 
A container called the bathtub is here. The bulk capacity of the bathtub is 100. A fixed in place thing called water is in the bathtub. A fixed in place thing called the drain is in the bathtub.

The block sleeping rule is not listed in any rulebook.
After sleeping when the player is on the small bed and the player is reclining:
	say "You fall asleep and forget the world.";
	forget everything;
	say "You wake feeling refreshed."

Test me with "remember pillow / recall / get pillow / remember pillow / get sheet / get book / recall / s / remember door / recall / unlock door / open door / recall / remember door / recall / w / remember comb / put sheet in bathtub / remember bathtub / drop pillow / put book on counter / e / n / recall / forget 10 / forget 4 / recall / forget 1 / recall / lie on bed / sleep / recall".
