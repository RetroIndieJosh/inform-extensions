Section 1 - Setup

The auto memory is some text that varies.
The custom memory is some text that varies.

Section 2 - Remembering Things

A thing can be remembered. A thing is usually not remembered. 
A thing has a room called the remembered location.
A thing can be known locked, known unlocked, or unknown lock state. A thing is usually unknown lock state.
A thing can be known open, known closed, or unknown open state. A thing is usually unknown open state.

Remembering it is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand "remember [something]" as remembering it.
Check remembering it:
	if the noun is carried by the player, say "You're already holding [the noun]! No need to remember it." instead;
Carry out remembering it:
	if the noun is remembered, say "You examine [the noun] and see what's changed.";
	otherwise say "You will remember [the noun].";
	remember the noun.
	
To remember (item - a thing):
	now item is remembered;
	now the remembered location of item is the location of item;
	if item is openable:
		if item is open, now item is known open;
		otherwise now item is known closed;
	if item is lockable:
		if item is locked, now item is known locked;
		otherwise now item is known unlocked;
	if item is a container:
		repeat with inner-item running through things in item:
			remember inner-item;
	if item is a supporter:
		repeat with inner-item running through things on item:
			remember inner-item.

Section 3 Remembering Text

Remembering is an action applying to one topic. Understand "remember [text]" as remembering.
Carry out remembering: add custom memory the topic understood.
Report remembering: say "You will remember [the topic understood]."
To add custom memory (addend - text):
	let current-text be the custom memory;
	now the custom memory is "[current-text][br] - [addend]".

Section 4 - Recalling

The block thinking rule is not listed in any rulebook.
Carry out thinking: try recalling.

Recalling is an action applying to nothing. Understand "recall" and "ponder" and "think" and "consider" as recalling.
Report recalling: 
	if the auto memory is not "", say "[auto memory][/p]";
	if the custom memory is not "", sayn "You recall: [custom memory]";
	let count be 0;
	repeat with target running through remembered things:
		if the target is on a remembered supporter or the target is in a remembered container, next;
		say "([count + 1]) [the target] - [the remembered location of the target]";
		if the target is known locked:
			say " (locked)";
		otherwise if the target is known unlocked:
			say " (unlocked)";
		if the target is known open:
			say " (open)";
		otherwise if the target is known closed:
			say " (closed)";
		if the target is a container:
			if the target is not openable or the target is open:
				say " (containing [the list of remembered things in the target])";
		if the target is a supporter:
			if the target is not openable or the target is open:
				say " (supporting [the list of remembered things on the target])";
		increment count;
		say "[br]";
	if the auto memory is "" and the custom memory is "" and count is 0:
		say "You don't remember anything in particular."

Section 5 - Forgetting Text

	forget the noun;
	continue the action.

Before dropping a thing which is not remembered (this is the remember things you drop rule):
	remember the noun;
	continue the action.

After dropping a remembered thing (this is the update remembered things you drop rule):

After putting a not remembered thing on a supporter:
	remember the noun;
	remember the second noun;
	continue the action.

Section 7 Forgetting Things

Forgetting it wrongly is an action applying to one topic. Understand "forget [text]" as forgetting it wrongly. Carry out forgetting it wrongly: say "You must provide a number from the RECALL list to forget a thing."

Forgetting it is an action applying to one number. Understand "forget [number]" as forgetting it.
Check forgetting it:
	if the number understood is greater than the number of remembered things, say "That's not a thing you can forget." instead.
Carry out forgetting it:
	let count be 0;
	let forgot be 0;
	repeat with item running through the list of remembered things:
		if item is in a remembered container or item is on a remembered supporter, next;
		increment count;
		if count is the number understood:
			say "You forget [the item].";
			forget item;
			now forgot is 1;
	if forgot is 0:
		say "That's not a thing you can forget."

To forget (item - a thing):
	now item is not remembered;
	now item is unknown lock state;
	now item is unknown open state.

Memory ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

This extension adds commands REMEMBER and RECALL (with synonyms CONSIDER, THINK, and PONDER).

The author may add special hint-like memories by setting the global variable auto memory.

	The auto memory is now "You're late for your doctor's appointment. Get to it!"

The player may REMEMBER any text to add it in a note-like memory list accessible with RECALL.

The player may also REMEMBER any visible thing, adding a note to their RECALL about its last remembered location.

If the player picks something up that they remember, they will automatically forget it. If they drop it, they automatically remember where it was dropped. To remove this automation say

	The remember things you drop rule is not listed in any rulebook.
	The forget things you take rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Even without this rule, if the player drops a remembered thing, the memory will be updated when they drop it.

Example: * Auto memory hints - Create memories for the player to ponder.
